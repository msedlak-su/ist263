        Hello! I am Madeline Sedlak and I am a Fashion Design major in VPA. While I am interested in fashion, I’m also interested in several other at forms such as photography, painting, drawing, and design. Other than the arts, I’ve discovered a new interest for the web after taking a data analytics class last semester. My most valuable skills would be my creativity, my eye for detail, and collaborating well with others. My all-time favorite TV show is Vampire Diaries, and I also love The Bachelor. I’m not much of a reader but, I would like to get into it. I love to cook and bake, specifically when I’m back my home in New Jersey with my little sister. I’m the oldest of 4 siblings, them being my 19 year old sister, Kathryn, who also goes to school here at Syracuse, my 18 year old brother, Jack, who will be attending Villanova in the fall, and 16 year old sister Chloe. I have a English Labrador, Eli, and my family and I hoping to get a puppy this Spring.
